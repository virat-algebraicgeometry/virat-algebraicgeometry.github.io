# Virat Chauhan's Math Expository Website

Welcome to my GitHub-based website! Here, I will be posting my expository writings, articles, and various insights on topics in mathematics, including:

- Algebraic Geometry
- Category Theory
- Homological Algebra
- Homotopical Algebra
- Spectral Algebraic Geometry
- Derived Algebraic Geometry
- Motives and more!

Feel free to explore the content, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for anyone interested in these mathematical areas.

## What You'll Find Here

### Expository Writings
Deep dives into mathematical topics, ranging from motives to stacks, all explained with clarity and detail.

### Research Articles
Papers and drafts related to my current research interests in **motives**, **Hodge conjecture**, and the intersections of **homotopy theory** and **algebraic geometry**.

### Exploratory Articles
Shorter articles or blog-style entries where I explore specific problems, ideas, and ongoing research, such as:

- **Generalization of Grothendieck Galois Theory** over smooth topology
- Connections between **simplicial homotopy theory** and **spectral algebraic geometry**

### Seminar Notes
Notes from talks and seminars I have delivered, such as my recent seminar at BBD University, covering various advanced topics.
